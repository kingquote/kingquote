Talk about how you explored data. What features you chose and what features you created, and why you chose them.
 - gender: 1 and 0 
 - Embarked: onehotencoding
 - Age: replaced missing values with the mean

Talk about different algorithms you tested and what results you got with them.
 - Neural Network same as digit recognition, just to test. Result: model says everyone survives, is roughly 40% correct by luck.
 - RandomForestClassifier with default values from ScikitLearn. Result: roughly 74% accuracy
 - RandomForestClassifier with Gridsearch: 75.8%

Talk about how you evaluated and validated your model.
 - accuracy score (% predicted correctly of all predictions) for training set.
 - score from kaggle for test data, is also accuracy score.
